    "bio": "As a beginning developer, I possess a solid computer science foundation and a tidy coding style. I pay attention to not only implementation but also the design. In my opinion, a reasonable design is necessary and could make the development process smooth and clear. Outside of work, my favorite hobby is photography. Visual aesthetics is what I have been always seeking. That's also one of the reasons why I choose to start my career from the front-end.",
