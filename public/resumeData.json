    "bio":"As a beginning developer, I possess solid computer science foundation and tidy coding style. I pay attention to not only implementation, but also the design. In my opinion, a resonable design is necessary and could make the development process smooth and clear. Outside of work, my favourite hobby is photography. Visual aesthetics is what I have been always seeking for. That's also one of the reasons why I choose to start my career from the front-end.",
